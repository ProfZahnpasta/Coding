        That was close - a game what you have to quit to win <br>

        This game isn't that easy to close. <br>
        But that's what you're supposed to do... <br>
        Try to quit the game by solving small puzzles! <br>
        The gameplay is about 5 minutes long and it works with pygame. <br>
        We hope you have much fun playing this game!
